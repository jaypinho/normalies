<p>Sadly, it does. The thing about bigotry, authoritarianism, and official lying is that, like diseases, they quickly pervade any environment that doesn't immediately reject them.</p>

<p>Journalists are particularly susceptible to letting indiscretions slide when they can be portrayed as minor. Gaining and maintaining access to those in power is a key part of reporters' jobs; hence the term 'source greasing' (more on that <a href="http://www.cjr.org/politics/profiles_in_source_greasing.php">here</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/02/AR2009070202686.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>The inevitable imbalance of power between a Donald Trump administration and the press, along with journalists' desire for access, will place enormous pressure on news organizations to compromise their assessments of the most extreme elements of Donald Trump's governing philosophy, rhetoric, and approach to the Constitution, as well as those of his senior staff and Cabinet appointments.</p>

<p>Donald Trump may be the President-elect, but that doesn't mean anything about him or his advisers is normal.</p>

<p>So let's not normalize them.</p>
